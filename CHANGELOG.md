# Changelog

## 1.0.3 - 2026-06-11

- Sign CycloneDX SBOM JSON with an embedded signature (RS256) via Azure Key Vault.
- Export the signing certificate from a signed SBOM (`--export-key`) for use with `cdx-verify`.
- `signature.certificatePath` always contains the leaf certificate only.
- Clear, actionable error messages for missing files, invalid JSON, missing flag values, and Azure Key Vault API failures.
- Exact pin of the `canonicalize` dependency to keep signatures stable across installs.
